        <h2>Why Coding From Scratch Matters For Small Business Websites</h2>
        <p><strong>Speed:</strong><br>For small business websites, custom coding from scratch offers significant advantages over well known page builders like WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace. When we hand-code your site, we're building exactly what your business needs, no extra code that slows down your site. This means faster loading speeds, which is critical since <a href="https://blog.google/products/admanager/increase-speed-of-your-mobile-site-wi/" class="interior-links">53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than three seconds to load.</a> Every second counts when a potential customer is deciding whether to call you or your competitor.<br><br>
            <strong>Security:</strong><br>
        Custom-coded sites are also more secure. Page builders rely on countless plugins and third-party add-ons that create vulnerabilities hackers can exploit. With clean, custom code, there are fewer entry points for security threats, and you're not dependent on plugin developers to patch security holes.<br><br>
        <strong>Rankings in Google Searches:</strong><br>
        Perhaps most importantly for your bottom line, custom-coded sites perform better in Google search rankings. Google prioritizes fast, clean websites that provide good user experiences. Page builders come loaded with bloated code and unnecessary features that slow everything down. Our streamlined approach means your site loads quickly, works flawlessly on mobile devices, and gives Google exactly what it's looking for, all of which helps local customers find you first.

        <h2>What is SEO, Really</h2>
        <p>Search Engine Optimization, a term used frequently in marketing and web design agencies. It's often misunderstood and sometimes used to sell you unnecessary products or services. So what does it really mean?</p>
        <p>Basically, SEO is making sure your website shows up when people search Google for services like yours. When someone searches "roofing in Harrisburg PA," Google decides which websites to show first based on several key factors. Some of the most important ones are load speed, mobile-friendliness, and ease of navigation. But the biggest factor is your content itself, the words and images on your pages. You need quality content that clearly explains what you do, where you serve, and why customers should choose you. Well-written, organized information helps both Google and your potential customers understand your business. For local searches, having a complete and up-to-date Google Business Profile is crucial. This crucial part of your online presence can be the difference between showing up first or not showing up at all when nearby customers are searching for your services. Optimizing your site is never guaranteed to produce immediate results, but including all these elements when building a website is crucial to getting ranked. We make sure to build a solid foundation for your new investment.</p>
        <h2>A Simple Way To Grow Your Local Visibility on Google</h2>
        <p>One of the most important factors in Google's rankings for local searches is your Google Business Profile. This free tool is powerful for reaching local customers, but only if it's set up correctly and kept up to date. When potential customers search for services like yours, Google shows them businesses with complete, and accurate information; your hours, services, contact details, and customer reviews. If your profile is incomplete or outdated, you're invisible to customers who are ready to hire. We know managing this can feel overwhelming if you're not familiar with how it works. That's why our monthly plan includes setting up and maintaining your Google Business Profile, so you show up when local customers are searching.</p>
