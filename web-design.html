        <h2>Our Design Process</h2>
        <p>You deserve access to quality web design without the huge price tag or the headache of trying to figure it out yourself. When you work with us, we focus on three things: simplicity, clear communication of what your business does, and making it easy for potential clients to reach you. No confusion, no clutter, just a clean site that tells customers what you do and how to contact you when they’re ready to hire.</p>
        <h2>What Makes A Good Web Design</h2>
        <p>What makes a good web design that actually works for your business? While everyone has an opinion (like whether a hot dog is a sandwich or not), the research is clear, functionality makes a huge impact. In fact, <a href="https://clutch.co/resources/website-redesign-checklist" class="interior-links">42% of people leave a website because it's cluttered or confusing.</a> We've all landed on those sites that look expensive but make it impossible to find what you need. You’re probably not selling Lamborghini's or Rolex watches, so let’s build a website that actually reflects what you provide. That's why we prioritize simple designs that provide clear communication about the services and/or products you provide. Our goal is to create a website that's easy to use, accessible to all visitors, and reflects your unique brand without the clutter that drives customers away.</p>
        <h3 class="blue-h3">Items to Highlight on Your Site</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use High Quality Photos of Your Work</li>
            <li>Have A Clear Way For Prospects to Reach You</li>
            <li>Clearly Define What You Do Best</li>
            <li>Inform Potential Customers About Your Industry and its Best Practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="pricing-details">What Should a Good Design Cost?</h2>
        <p>Finding a good design can be challenging enough — figuring out what you should pay for it is even harder. Let's break down what actually goes into building a quality website so you understand where your investment goes.
            <ol start="0">
                <li class="dev-h3"><strong>What Goes Into Building a High Quality Website:</strong></li>
                <li>Design: A professional layout that fits all your business information and looks great.</li>
                <li>Copywriting: Well-written content that speaks to your customers and clearly explains what you do.</li>
                <li>Development: The technical work of coding your site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, (the languages that browsers use to read a website).</li>
                <li>Hosting: Server space that keeps your website live and accessible 24/7.</li>
                <li>Domain Name: Your internet address (like harvestclicks.com) that customers use to find you.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Each of these pieces requires different skills and time, which is where most of the cost comes from. There are also ongoing expenses for hosting and domain registration.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Simple Pricing</strong>
        We keep things straightforward — no hidden fees, no surprises. Always make sure you know exactly what you're being charged for when working with any web designer or developer.
        <ul class="monthly-list">
            <li class="dev-h3"><strong>Our Monthly Plan: $155 per month.</strong><br>
            <span>Everything listed above, plus:</span><br></li>
            <li>Google Business Profile setup and maintenance</li>
            <li>Lifetime website updates</li>
            <li>Hosting and domain fees included</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Upfront Plan: $2175 + $25 per month.</strong><br>
        All design, copywriting, and development costs paid upfront, then just $25/month for hosting, plus your annual domain fee. This plan applies only to static/informational websites. We can build E-commerce sites too, but since there is a lot more that goes into those kinds of websites, we don’t have a standard price plan. Send us a message, and we’ll gladly give you a quote, if that is what your business needs! </p>
        <p><strong>More about our monthly plan:</strong><br>
        Starting a new business is hard enough without having to pay a large sum of money for a quality website right off the bat. That’s why we offer a monthly payment option. This is not a loan; just simply a different payment option for a slightly different service. Same great web design, but you have the flexibility to update content, or pictures and videos, on us whenever you need it. We aim to provide more value to the service, while giving you a better chance to succeed early in business!</p>
        <p>*Note: Some premium domain names may have higher initial purchase costs; we'll let you know upfront if this applies to your preferred name.</p>

        <h2>Mobile First Design</h2>
        <p>Every website we build is designed for mobile devices first. In today’s fast-paced, instant-access society, <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" class="interior-links">about 60% of your potential customers will find you on their smartphone.</a> If your site doesn't work well on mobile, you may have lost a client that is ready to hire. That's why we ensure your website looks clean and professional on every device, from the smallest smartphone to tablets and desktop computers. No matter how someone finds you, they'll get the same simple, easy-to-navigate experience that showcases your business in the most appealing way.</p>
